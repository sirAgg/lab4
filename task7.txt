I didn't really learn anything.

I belive the instructions can be a lot clearer. Especially
in task3 it says we should store Point2D objects in an array,
but later in the lab you imply that we should store them as
an array on pointers to Point2D objects "(i.e. replace with nullptr, ..."
This have led to alot of confusion and different implementations.
      
I have spent about 4-6 hours on this lab
